# Navigation-app-
This is a repository of an android based navigation app for my university.

The app is all about navigating a new visitor in university to a particular destination/block/Schools of University.
Mapbox is used for the above app.

#Error in this application is:

The app runs properly when first time installed in the mobile.

When the app is restarted, it crashes as soon as the map is loaded on display.
If the cache is cleared from app settings in mobile, it again works fine.

We tried clearing the cache automatically through program, but that doesn't seem to work here.

The stack trace shows the area of code where the user's current location is fetched (enableLocationComponent).
